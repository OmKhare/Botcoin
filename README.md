# Botcoin
This is a basic simulation of how cryptocurrenies work using blockchain technology. 
<br>I took inspiration from https://savjee.github.io/savjeecoin-frontend/ 
## Note
<br>I have done this project using React & MongoDB & it helped me a lot in understanding Blockchain, MERN stack, crypto etc
<br>I have actually implemented the blockchain using **SHA-256** hashing.
<br>
<br>Following external libraries are used:
- Elliptic
- crypto-js
- axios
>Since this is a simulation, I have myself mined the botcoin. Hence we see 100 mining reward granted by the system to our public ID


## Project
This is my home page where currently it is showing transactions for Genesis Block (Initial block which does not contain any transactions.
> Notice the hash of one block and hash of previous block

<br>This is the 2nd Block

<br>
<br>And our new transaction is created!
